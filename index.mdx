## Introduction to TRE

Temporal Resonance Engineering (TRE) is the study and practical application of manipulating time-adjacent frequencies to achieve controlled temporal effects without violating causality principles. This knowledge base contains classified research and operational procedures developed over the past four decades.

<Warning>
  **Certification Required**: All practitioners must complete TRE Council Level 2 certification before attempting any resonance manipulation procedures.

## The TRE Paradox

<Note>
  The fundamental challenge of TRE is maintaining observer causality while manipulating temporal frequencies. All procedures must account for the Observer Consistency Principle (OCP) to prevent reality fragmentation.
</Note>

## Historical Context

TRE emerged from theoretical work in the 1980s when Dr. Helena Voss first proposed that temporal flow operated on quantized frequencies similar to electromagnetic radiation. The field remained theoretical until 1997 when the Heisenberg Institute successfully demonstrated the first controlled temporal resonance in laboratory conditions.
