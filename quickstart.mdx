## Prerequisites

Before beginning any temporal resonance work, ensure you have the following:

<Warning>
  **CRITICAL**: Never attempt temporal resonance without proper safety equipment. Unshielded exposure to temporal fields can result in retrograde temporal displacement or observer desynchronization.
</Warning>

<Check>
  - TRE Council Level 2 Certification or supervised training authorization
  - Calibrated TR-7000 or TR-9000 series resonator
  - Temporal field detector with minimum 0.01 femtosecond resolution
  - Faraday-Heisenberg shielded environment
  - Emergency temporal anchor beacon
</Check>

## Step 1: Environment Preparation

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="radar" title="Establish baseline temporal field reading">
    Before introducing any resonance, you must document the ambient temporal field state. This serves as your reference point.

    ```bash Terminal
    tre-cli calibrate --environment --duration 300s
    ```

    Expected output should show temporal variance below 0.05fs with no harmonic peaks above background noise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="microchip" title="Initialize your resonator">
    Connect to your temporal resonator and initialize the control system:

    ```bash Terminal
    tre-cli resonator connect --device /dev/tres0
    tre-cli resonator init --frequency 2.847GHz --power 0.1
    ```

    <Note>Always start at minimum power (0.1) to avoid cascade resonance effects.</Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Verify shielding integrity">
    Confirm your Faraday-Heisenberg shielding is functioning correctly:

    ```bash Terminal
    tre-cli shield verify --full-spectrum
    ```

    All zones must report "NOMINAL" status before proceeding.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Step 2: First Resonance Experiment

Now you're ready to induce your first controlled temporal resonance.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set target frequency">
    Calculate your target frequency based on local temporal field characteristics:

    ```python
    from tre_sdk import TemporalField, Resonator

    # Read ambient field
    field = TemporalField.measure()

    # Calculate first harmonic
    target_freq = field.base_frequency * 1.618  # Golden ratio harmonic

    print(f"Target frequency: {target_freq} GHz")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Engage resonance">
    Slowly ramp up resonator power while monitoring field coherence:

    ```python
    resonator = Resonator.connect('/dev/tres0')
    resonator.set_frequency(target_freq)

    # Gradual power ramp
    for power in range(10, 50, 5):
        resonator.set_power(power / 100)
        time.sleep(2)

        coherence = field.measure_coherence()
        if coherence < 0.85:
            resonator.emergency_stop()
            raise TemporalInstabilityError("Coherence too low!")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Observe temporal distortion">
    With resonance established, you should observe measurable temporal field distortion:

    ```python
    distortion = field.measure_distortion()
    print(f"Temporal distortion: {distortion.magnitude} fs/s")
    print(f"Distortion vector: {distortion.vector}")
    ```

    For a successful first experiment, expect distortion magnitude between 0.5-2.0 femtoseconds per second.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Safe Shutdown

<Warning>
  **NEVER** abruptly terminate a resonance field. This can cause temporal backlash and damage the local field structure.
</Warning>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="power-off" title="Gradual power reduction">
    Slowly reduce resonator power over at least 60 seconds:

    ```python
    resonator.gradual_shutdown(duration=60)
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="chart-line" title="Monitor field stabilization">
    Continue monitoring temporal field readings until they return to baseline:

    ```bash Terminal
    tre-cli monitor --until-stable --max-wait 600s
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="file-lines" title="Document results">
    Log all experimental parameters and results:

    ```bash Terminal
    tre-cli log save --session current --notes "First resonance experiment"
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Resonator won't initialize" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Check that your temporal field detector is properly calibrated. Run `tre-cli calibrate --detector` and try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Coherence drops below 0.85" icon="circle-exclamation">
    This indicates temporal field instability. Reduce power immediately and check for external temporal interference sources.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Observer desynchronization warnings" icon="skull">
    Immediately evacuate the shielded environment and wait 30 minutes before re-entry. Your temporal reference frame may have shifted.
