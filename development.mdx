<Warning>
  **Mandatory Safety Training Required**

  All personnel must complete TRE Council Safety Certification before operating temporal resonance equipment. Violations will result in immediate certification suspension and potential legal consequences.
</Warning>

## Laboratory Requirements

Before conducting any TRE operations, your laboratory must meet minimum safety standards:

<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - TRE Council Level 2 facility certification
  - Faraday-Heisenberg shielding (minimum Level 2)
  - Emergency temporal anchor beacon system
  - Isolated power supply with UPS backup (>30 minutes)
  - Environmental monitoring systems
  - Emergency response protocol documentation
</Info>

## Essential Safety Equipment

<Steps>
<Step title="Faraday-Heisenberg Shielding">

All TRE operations must be conducted within proper shielding to prevent external interference and contain temporal field effects.

```bash
# Verify shielding integrity
tre-cli shield verify --full-spectrum --device /dev/shield0

# Expected output:
# All zones: NOMINAL
# Attenuation: >120 dB @ 0-50 GHz
# Temporal isolation factor: 45.3
# Status: OPERATIONAL ✓
```

<Note>
  Schedule monthly shielding inspections. Annual recertification required by TRE Council.
</Note>

</Step>

<Step title="Emergency Stop System">

Install and test emergency stop systems before each session:

```bash
# Test emergency stop circuit
tre-cli safety test-emergency-stop

# Configure emergency triggers
tre-cli safety configure-triggers \
  --coherence-min 0.75 \
  --power-max-deviation 0.3 \
  --temporal-gradient-max 0.1
```

All operators must have immediate access to manual emergency stop buttons located at each workstation and room exit.

</Step>

<Step title="Temporal Field Monitoring">

Continuous monitoring of temporal field parameters is mandatory:

```bash
# Initialize monitoring system
tre-cli monitor start \
  --sample-rate 100 \
  --alert-coherence 0.85 \
  --alert-gradient 0.05 \
  --log-directory /var/log/tre

# Monitoring dashboard accessible at:
# https://monitor.tre-lab.local:8443
```

</Step>
</Steps>

## Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Required PPE">
    **Mandatory for all personnel in active TRE areas**:

    - Temporal field exposure badge (dosimeter)
    - Safety glasses (temporal-grade UV protection)
    - Grounding strap (prevents observer desynchronization)
    - Emergency temporal anchor (wearable device)

    ```bash
    # Verify PPE calibration
    tre-cli ppe verify-all
    ```
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Exposure Limits">
    **Maximum Temporal Field Exposure**:

    | Duration | Max TIF Exposure | Field Strength |
    |----------|------------------|----------------|
    | 15 minutes | 10 | <0.5 nT |
    | 1 hour | 5 | <0.2 nT |
    | 8 hours (daily) | 2 | <0.1 nT |

    Exceeding these limits requires Level 4 authorization and medical supervision.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Dosimeter Reading">
    ```bash
    # Read temporal exposure dosimeter
    tre-cli ppe read-dosimeter --badge-id TED-12345

    # Output:
    # Total exposure today: 3.2 TIF-hours
    # Peak exposure: 8.7 TIF @ 14:32:15
    # Status: WITHIN LIMITS ✓
    # Days until reset: 1
    ```

    <Warning>
      If dosimeter shows "OVEREXPOSURE", immediately evacuate shielded area and report to medical personnel.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
