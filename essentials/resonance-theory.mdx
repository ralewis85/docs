## Fundamentals of Temporal Resonance

Temporal resonance occurs when an external frequency source matches one of the natural harmonic frequencies of a temporal field. This sympathetic vibration can amplify, dampen, or shift the local temporal field characteristics.

<Info>
  The first controlled temporal resonance was achieved on March 15, 1997 at the Heisenberg Institute by Dr. Marcus Chen using a prototype TR-1000 resonator.

## Harmonic Series

Every temporal field supports a series of resonant frequencies based on its base temporal frequency (BTF):

```
f_n = f_0 × (n × φ)
```

Where:
- `f_n` = nth harmonic frequency
- `f_0` = base temporal frequency
- `n` = harmonic number (positive integer)
- `φ` = golden ratio (1.618033988...)

The use of the golden ratio ensures maximum field stability and minimum destructive interference.

## Resonance Modes

### Sympathetic Resonance

When a resonator matches a harmonic frequency precisely, energy transfers efficiently into the temporal field with minimal losses.

```python
from tre_sdk import Resonator, TemporalField

# Measure field and calculate target
field = TemporalField.measure()
target = field.base_frequency * 1.618

# Engage sympathetic resonance
resonator = Resonator.connect('/dev/tres0')
resonator.set_frequency(target)
resonator.set_mode('sympathetic')
resonator.set_power(0.3)
```

### Destructive Resonance

Intentionally using out-of-phase frequencies to dampen or suppress temporal field fluctuations.

<Warning>
  Destructive resonance can cause field fragmentation if not properly controlled. Always monitor coherence levels.
</Warning>

```python
# Dampening an unstable field region
resonator.set_frequency(target)
resonator.set_phase(math.pi)  # 180 degrees out of phase
resonator.set_mode('destructive')
resonator.set_power(0.2)
```

### Cascade Resonance

Simultaneously exciting multiple harmonics to create complex temporal field effects.

<Warning>
  **EXTREMELY DANGEROUS**

  Cascade resonance can lead to uncontrolled temporal feedback loops. Only attempt under controlled laboratory conditions with Level 5 supervision.
</Warning>

## Resonance Coupling

The strength of resonance coupling depends on several factors:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Frequency Precision">
    Frequency must match target harmonic within ±0.001 GHz

    ```python
    # Check frequency lock status
    status = resonator.get_lock_status()
    print(f"Frequency error: {status.frequency_error} GHz")
    print(f"Lock quality: {status.lock_quality}")
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Power Calibration">
    Power levels must be tuned to field strength

    ```python
    # Auto-calibrate power for optimal coupling
    field_strength = field.measure_strength()
    optimal_power = resonator.calculate_optimal_power(field_strength)
    resonator.set_power(optimal_power)
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase Alignment">
    Phase must be synchronized with field oscillation

    ```python
    # Automatic phase alignment
    resonator.enable_phase_lock()
    resonator.wait_for_phase_lock(timeout=30)
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Coupling Coefficient

The coupling coefficient `C` determines the efficiency of energy transfer:

```
C = (P_field / P_resonator) × cos(Δφ)
```

Where:
- `P_field` = power absorbed by field
- `P_resonator` = power output by resonator
- `Δφ` = phase difference

Optimal coupling occurs when `C ≥ 0.95`.

```python
# Monitor coupling efficiency
metrics = resonator.get_metrics()
coupling = metrics.coupling_coefficient

if coupling < 0.95:
    print("⚠️ Suboptimal coupling, adjusting parameters...")
    resonator.auto_tune()
```

## Resonance Effects

### Temporal Acceleration

Positive resonance increases the local temporal frequency, causing time to flow faster relative to baseline.

<Info>
  A 1% increase in temporal frequency means 1 second of subjective time passes in 0.99 seconds of external time.
</Info>

### Temporal Deceleration

Negative resonance (destructive interference) decreases local temporal frequency.

### Field Coherence

Resonance affects the coherence of the temporal field. High coherence = stable, predictable behavior.

```python
# Coherence monitoring during resonance
def monitor_resonance(duration):
    start_time = time.time()

    while time.time() - start_time < duration:
        coherence = field.measure_coherence()
        print(f"Coherence: {coherence:.3f}")

        if coherence < 0.85:
            resonator.reduce_power(0.05)
        elif coherence > 0.98:
            resonator.increase_power(0.02)

        time.sleep(5)
```

## Resonance Instabilities

### Beat Frequency

When two close but non-matching frequencies interfere:

```
f_beat = |f_1 - f_2|
```

Beat frequencies cause periodic oscillations in field strength. Avoid by maintaining precise frequency lock.

### Feedback Loops

If resonator frequency drifts into unintended harmonics, positive feedback can occur:

```python
# Feedback detection and prevention
monitor = FeedbackMonitor(resonator, field)

if monitor.detect_feedback():
    resonator.emergency_stop()
    print("⛔ Feedback loop detected - emergency shutdown")
```

### Harmonic Cross-Coupling

Multiple resonators operating simultaneously can create unintended harmonic interactions:

<Warning>
  Never operate more than one resonator in the same shielded environment without coordinated frequency management.
</Warning>
